#Project Pitch - Reis Thebault

This project will show who is bearing the brunt of U.S. oil refining. 

Some seven million Americans live near oil refineries. These “fenceline” or “frontline” communities face some of nation’s greatest burdens of pollution — stuff like toxins and lung-damaging particulates. As North America expands its role as a global petroleum producer, living in these communities will only become more dangerous. This data visualization will document the health risks that those who live closest to oil refineries face, and the demographic makeup of those people — who often are poorer and more diverse than average. Much has been written in various local and regional publications about fenceline communities, but these stories are disparate and focus only on a single site, city or region. No one has looked at all of the nation's refinery communities as a group, and tried to quantify the overall health cost of living there or their average demographic makeup.

I will use data from the Environmental Protection Agency’s ECHO database. I have already submitted a public records request and have received data on every operating oil refinery in the United States, and the demographic makeup of the areas in a 1, 3 and 5 mile radius of those refineries. Demographic categories include age, race, income and level of education. 

This idea, of course, lends itself to at least one map. One such example could be a map of, say, the area surrounding the Chevron refinery in Richmond, CA. This map would have a point or a flag at the location of the refinery and the 1, 3 or 5 mile radius shaded in — perhaps by census tract — on a gradient to indicate, for example, the income of the population surrounding the refinery. For reference, I might measure this against the state median income. 

It might also be interesting to use bar charts to measure the demographics of fence line communities as a whole against the U.S. population — or, perhaps, the aggregated population of states with oil refineries in them (however, if the point is to show the burden that fenceline communities bear on behalf of the United States as a whole, it might make more sense to compare fenceline communities to the country). 

As Dr. Robert Bullard, author of “Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Quality,” put it: “What we have is energy apartheid, where poor communities and poor communities of color are still getting the dirtiest of the dirty energy.”
